## 2026-03-16 Operational Status

- Continuous live samples are succeeding (`dispatchRun.ok=true`) with latest artifact:
  - `memory/context-db/sessions/codex-cli-20260303T080437-065e16c0/artifacts/dispatch-run-20260316T111419Z.json`
- `learn-eval` still recommends:
  - `[fix] runbook.failure-triage` (`clarity-needs-input=5`)
  - `[observe] sample.latency-watch` (`avgElapsedMs=160678`)
- Timeout budgets remain unchanged while latency-watch observation continues.
