# AIOS Runtime Adapter Boundary — Design

**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Status:** Approved for implementation

## Goal

Add the final runtime abstraction layer between AIOS orchestration and any future real execution runtime.

This layer should let AIOS keep its existing local-only orchestration intelligence while making future runtime integration additive instead of invasive.

## Problem

AIOS already has:

- blueprint-driven orchestration plans,
- dispatch policy derivation,
- local executor manifests and registry,
- local `dry-run` dispatch execution,
- preflight and evidence persistence.

What it still lacks is one stable boundary between:

- orchestration logic that decides what should run, and
- runtime logic that decides how a dispatch plan is executed.

Right now the local execution path is still effectively coupled to `executeLocalDispatchPlan()`. That is fine for the current slice, but it means any future real runtime would need to plug directly into orchestrator internals instead of implementing a clear adapter contract.

## Scope

This slice adds:

- a plan-level runtime adapter contract,
- a runtime registry and selection layer,
- one local runtime implementation for `dry-run`,
- additive `dispatchRun.runtime` metadata,
- lifecycle wiring so `orchestrate` executes through the runtime layer.

This slice does not:

- add any real model or remote runtime,
- add client-specific runtime adapters for Codex, Claude, Gemini, or OpenCode,
- expose provider/model/runtime details inside `dispatchPlan`,
- change existing blueprints, handoff schema, merge rules, or ContextDB schema.

## Why The Boundary Belongs Here

The current architecture already has the right lower-level primitive for local execution: job-level executors.
Those executors are useful, but they are too low-level to serve as the public runtime boundary.

The missing layer is above executors and below lifecycle:

- lifecycle should choose whether to execute,
- a runtime should execute the whole plan,
- local executors should remain an implementation detail of the local runtime.

This keeps `dispatchPlan` runtime-agnostic and prevents future real runtime integration from leaking into DAG construction.

## Recommended Approach

Use a plan-level runtime adapter abstraction.

### Option A: Plan-Level Runtime Adapter

Add a runtime registry that owns execution of the full `dispatchPlan`.
The current `local-dry-run` path becomes one runtime adapter that internally reuses the existing local executor registry.

Pros:

- clean separation between planning and execution,
- additive future integration point,
- no client-specific leakage into DAG/job schemas,
- preserves current local-only behavior.

Cons:

- adds one extra abstraction layer,
- requires some wiring refactor in lifecycle and orchestrator modules.

### Option B: Job-Level Runtime Adapter

Let each job choose its own runtime directly.

Pros:

- more granular,
- superficially flexible.

Cons:

- pushes execution concerns into DAG shape too early,
- likely wrong for real runtimes that may execute more than one job per session,
- would make future refactors more disruptive.

### Option C: Put Runtime Details Into `launchSpec`

Write future runtime selection into each job now.

Pros:

- looks explicit.

Cons:

- overfits the local-only stage,
- bloats `dispatchPlan` with premature provider/client details,
- makes the plan contract harder to change later.

### Recommendation

Choose Option A.

It gives AIOS one stable boundary before real runtime integration and keeps the current local orchestration model intact.

## Architecture

The runtime abstraction should create four layers:

1. `orchestrate` lifecycle
2. dispatch runtime layer
3. local executor registry
4. job-level local execution logic

### 1. Lifecycle Layer

`orchestrate` remains responsible for:

- option normalization,
- learn-eval overlay selection,
- dispatch policy derivation,
- optional preflight,
- dispatch plan generation,
- evidence persistence.

It should stop owning direct execution details for local dry-run mode.

### 2. Runtime Layer

Add a new module:

- `scripts/lib/harness/orchestrator-runtimes.mjs`

This module becomes the plan-level runtime boundary.
It should:

- expose the runtime catalog,
- select a runtime from execution context,
- validate runtime compatibility,
- execute the full dispatch plan,
- return normalized `dispatchRun` payloads.

### 3. Local Executor Registry

Keep the existing local executor registry in:

- `scripts/lib/harness/orchestrator-executors.mjs`

This stays job-level and local-only.
It should not become the public contract for future real runtimes.

### 4. Job Logic

Keep existing phase and merge-gate dry-run logic in orchestrator helpers.
That logic continues to power the local runtime implementation.

## Runtime Contract

The runtime contract is intentionally small.
Each runtime definition should provide:

- `id`
- `label`
- `requiresModel`
- `executionModes`
- `execute({ plan, dispatchPlan, dispatchPolicy, io, env })`

Suggested exported helpers:

- `listDispatchRuntimes()`
- `getDispatchRuntime(id)`
- `selectDispatchRuntime({ executionMode })`
- `createDispatchRuntimeRegistry(...)`
- `resolveDispatchRuntime(...)`

## Initial Runtime Catalog

This slice defines exactly one runtime:

- `local-dry-run`

Properties:

- `requiresModel=false`
- supports `executionMode=dry-run`
- internally delegates to the existing local dispatch execution path

This is intentionally narrow.
The purpose of the slice is to freeze the boundary, not to introduce additional runtime choices yet.
Future runtime metadata can move into a declarative spec without changing the runtime contract.

## Dispatch Plan Rules

`dispatchPlan` must remain runtime-agnostic.

This slice should not add fields such as:

- `launchSpec.runtime`
- `launchSpec.client`
- provider/model placeholders

`dispatchPlan` should continue to express only:

- jobs,
- dependencies,
- merge-gate structure,
- executor metadata,
- policy context.

That keeps planning independent from any future runtime implementation details.

## Dispatch Run Rules

`dispatchRun` should gain additive runtime metadata.

Suggested shape:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "id": "local-dry-run",
    "label": "Local Dry Run Runtime",
    "requiresModel": false,
    "executionMode": "dry-run"
  }
}
```

Existing fields such as these stay intact:

- `executorRegistry`
- `executorDetails`
- `jobRuns`
- `finalOutputs`
- `ok`

This lets downstream consumers distinguish:

- the runtime that executed the plan, and
- the executors that handled individual jobs.

## Execution Flow

### `executionMode=none`

- build orchestration plan,
- derive dispatch policy,
- optionally run preflight,
- build dispatch plan,
- do not resolve a runtime,
- do not produce `dispatchRun`.

### `executionMode=dry-run`

- build orchestration plan,
- derive dispatch policy,
- optionally run preflight,
- build dispatch plan,
- resolve runtime `local-dry-run`,
- execute the plan through the runtime layer,
- return `dispatchRun` with runtime metadata,
- persist dispatch evidence when session-backed.

## Failure Semantics

Three different signals must remain distinct.

### 1. Policy Blocked

`dispatchPolicy.status=blocked` means the workflow is not yet ready for a future real runtime.
This is a planning/policy signal.
It is not a runtime failure.

### 2. Runtime Result Blocked

`dispatchRun.ok=false` means the runtime executed successfully enough to produce a valid run result, but some job ended in a blocked state.
This is expected workflow behavior for cases such as merge-gate failure.
It should not throw.

### 3. Harness/Runtime Error

Unknown runtimes, unsupported execution modes, invalid runtime output, or adapter crashes should throw.
These represent contract or infrastructure failures, not workflow blockage.

The rule is:

- blocked workflow => structured result,
- broken harness/runtime => exception.

## Evidence And Artifact Behavior

This slice should keep the current evidence persistence model.
The only artifact-level change should be additive runtime metadata inside `dispatchRun`.

That means:

- existing dry-run evidence still persists through ContextDB,
- learn-eval can continue consuming dispatch evidence,
- old consumers are not broken because schema changes are additive.

## Testing Strategy

### Runtime Registry Tests

Add tests for:

- runtime catalog listing,
- lookup by runtime id,
- default runtime selection for `dry-run`,
- unsupported runtime resolution failures,
- unsupported execution mode failures.

### Runtime Delegation Tests

Add tests proving that the `local-dry-run` runtime delegates to the existing local dispatch execution path and preserves executor/job output fields.

### Lifecycle Integration Tests

Update orchestrator lifecycle tests to verify:

- `--execute dry-run` produces `dispatchRun.runtime`,
- `executionMode=none` does not resolve a runtime,
- preflight behavior remains unchanged,
- evidence persistence still works with runtime metadata present.

### Failure Path Tests

Add tests proving that:

- merge-gate blockage produces `dispatchRun.ok=false` without throwing,
- unknown runtime ids throw,
- unsupported execution modes throw,
- invalid runtime results throw.

## Risks

### Over-Abstraction

If the runtime interface tries to model future client/provider details now, the abstraction will calcify too early.
The interface must stay generic and plan-level.

### Blurred Failure Signals

If runtime exceptions are converted into blocked results, AIOS will stop distinguishing real harness bugs from expected workflow blockage.
That would weaken future operator decisions.

### Contract Drift

If `dispatchRun.runtime` is added inconsistently between live output and persisted artifacts, downstream consumers will receive ambiguous evidence.
The runtime metadata must be normalized once and reused everywhere.

## Success Criteria

This slice succeeds when:

- `orchestrate --execute dry-run` runs through a runtime adapter instead of calling local execution directly,
- `dispatchPlan` remains runtime-agnostic,
- `dispatchRun` carries stable runtime metadata,
- local dry-run behavior remains unchanged from an operator perspective,
- future real runtimes can be added without rewriting DAG or policy logic.

## Non-Goals

This slice does not:

- add real runtime adapters,
- launch real subagents,
- spend tokens,
- add client/provider routing flags,
- redesign the executor manifest,
- change ContextDB checkpoint schema.
