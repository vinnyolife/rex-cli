# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a local-first AI agent workspace centered on browser automation via MCP.

- `mcp-server/`: TypeScript Playwright MCP server (main runtime code).
- `mcp-server/src/index.ts`: MCP server entry point and tool routing.
- `mcp-server/src/browser/`: browser launcher, profile manager, auth checks, and tool actions.
- `config/`: runtime configuration such as `browser-profiles.json` and safety-related settings.
- `memory/`: JSON knowledge/skills/specs used by agent workflows.
- `docs/plans/`: implementation and design plans.
- `tasks/`: task templates and execution tracking artifacts.

Do not manually edit `mcp-server/dist/`; it is generated output.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run commands from `mcp-server/` unless noted:

- `npm install`: install dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: run MCP server from TypeScript with `tsx`.
- `npm run typecheck`: strict TS type validation (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `npm run build`: compile to `dist/`.
- `npm run start`: run built server (`node dist/index.js`).

Typical local flow:
```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript (ESM, strict mode).
- Indentation: 2 spaces; keep semicolons.
- File names: kebab-case for action modules (for example `auth-check.ts`), `index.ts` for module entry points.
- Tool names exposed to MCP should follow `browser_*` naming.
- Keep configuration JSON keys stable; prefer additive changes over renaming.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no dedicated automated test suite yet. Minimum verification for each change:

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run build`
3. Manual MCP smoke test (`browser_launch` -> `browser_navigate` -> `browser_snapshot`/`browser_auth_check` -> `browser_close`)

Document manual test steps in PRs when behavior changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history follows Conventional Commit style:
- `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`
- Optional scope is common (for example `feat(skills): ...`).

PRs should include:
- concise problem/solution summary,
- affected paths,
- verification evidence (command output or checklist),
- screenshots/log snippets for browser-flow changes,
- linked task/issue when applicable.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit credentials, cookies, or personal browser profile data.
- Prefer CDP-based profile config in `config/browser-profiles.json` for stable login reuse.
- Preserve human-in-the-loop checks for auth walls and sensitive outbound actions.

## Agent Shortcut Conventions
- `cap` is a repository shortcut for `commit + push`.
- Trigger: when the user message is exactly `cap`, execute this flow in the current repo.
- Required flow:
  1. `git status --short` and confirm there are changes.
  2. If behavior/commands/workflow changed, sync impacted skill docs first (keep `.codex/skills/*` and `.claude/skills/*` aligned).
  3. `git add -A`.
  4. Commit with a Conventional Commit message from current task context.
  5. If no clear message is available, use fallback `chore: cap snapshot <YYYY-MM-DD>`.
  6. `git push` (or set upstream once when required).
- If there are no changes, report a no-op instead of creating an empty commit.
