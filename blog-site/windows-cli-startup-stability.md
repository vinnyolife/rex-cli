# AIOS Windows Update: Not Just "Startup Fix", But a Full Cross-CLI Reliability Chain

This update is directly tied to AIOS core architecture, not a generic Windows tip post.

## Quick Answer

AIOS has three connected layers:

1. Bridge layer: `contextdb-shell-bridge.mjs` decides wrap vs passthrough
2. Session layer: `ctx-agent` injects/reuses ContextDB session context
3. Execution layer: your native CLI (`codex` / `claude` / `gemini`) runs as usual

The Windows cmd-backed launcher fix landed in layer 1, but it protects the whole chain.

## Why This Is Specifically About AIOS

Without AIOS, a `.cmd` startup issue is mostly a CLI boot issue.

With AIOS, that same issue breaks:

- context continuity (`session -> context:pack -> inject`)
- wrapper policy behavior (`repo-only` / `opt-in` / `all`)
- downstream orchestrated flows that assume stable agent entry

So this is not an isolated shell tweak. It preserves AIOS's cross-CLI workflow contract.

## What Changed

In the shared process launcher + `contextdb-shell-bridge` path, cmd-backed launch handling on Windows is now safer:

- npm/cmd launcher resolution is more robust
- unresolved wrapper entrypoints fall back with safer shell behavior
- native executables are still preferred when available

Coverage includes Codex, Claude, and Gemini wrapper startup paths.

## Reproduce in 60 Seconds

Pull latest `main`, restart terminal, then run:

```bash
codex
```

Then validate bridge routing diagnostics:

```bash
export CTXDB_DEBUG=1
codex
```

Expected outcome:

- startup no longer fails on cmd-wrapper edge cases
- bridge can still decide wrap/passthrough correctly
- context-aware workflow remains usable without changing your daily command

## End-to-End Value (AIOS View)

This fix protects the chain:

`shell wrapper -> contextdb-shell-bridge -> ctx-agent -> contextdb -> native CLI`

If one link breaks on Windows, your "cross-CLI with memory" promise breaks. This update hardens that link.

## FAQ

### Do I need to change commands?

No. Keep using `codex`, `claude`, `gemini` as before.

### Is this only about shell startup?

No. It is a startup-layer fix with workflow-level impact in AIOS because wrapping and session context depend on that entry path.

### Does this change token usage?

No direct model policy change. This update targets process reliability and wrapper behavior.
