# I Finally Built the Tool That Ends the 'Which AI Coding Tool Is Better' Debate

Honestly? I used to get completely wrecked by three AI coding tools.

Claude Code is great at coding but browser automation setup is a pain.
Codex automation is satisfying but it falls short on complex code refactoring.
Gemini is good at research but goes off the rails when you actually put it to work.

"Why can't one tool do everything?" — I kept wondering.

So I built it myself.

---

## 01. What Problems Was I Running Into?

### Scenario 1: Browser Automation

I wanted to auto-post to Xiaohongshu.

Use Claude Code? Okay, first configure MCP. 3 hours later, it finally works. Wake up next morning — account got flagged.

Use Codex? Out of the box, works great. But halfway through, wanted Claude to optimize the code — switched tools and — **all context gone**, start from scratch.

### Scenario 2: Long Task Interruption

Running a code refactoring task, 2000+ lines. Had a meeting, came back to continue —

Claude: I remember roughly where I was, but forgot the details.
Codex: I remember roughly where I was, but the refactoring direction drifted.
Gemini: Who am I, where am I?

**That was my daily life: either switching tools or re-configuring everything.**

## 02. What Is RexCLI?

**RexCLI = Claude Code + Codex + Gemini working together, without fighting each other.**

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Unified browser automation | Any CLI, same `browser_*` commands |
| Cross-CLI context memory | Tool switch without losing progress |
| Privacy Guard | Auto-redacts config files, prevents API key leaks |

### How It Works

```
You type codex/claude/gemini
       ↓
RexCLI intercepts automatically
       ↓
Decision: wrap or pass through?
       ↓
Wrap: connect ContextDB + Browser MCP
Pass-through: deliver to native tool
```

**You don't need to change any habits.** Keep using the same commands as before.

---

## 03. Real Results

### Result 1: Browser Automation

```bash
# Before: using Codex
codex

# Now: still using Codex, but with superpowers
codex
```

The difference is now you have unified `browser_*` tools:
- `browser_navigate` — open a page
- `browser_click` — click an element
- `browser_snapshot` — get page content
- `browser_screenshot` — take a screenshot

**No matter which CLI you switch to, these commands work.**

### Result 2: Resume from Breakpoint

What if you're halfway through a task and want to switch tools?

```bash
# Ran half the task with Codex
codex

# Switch to Claude to continue, context syncs automatically
claude
```

**No copy-pasting, no re-explaining the task.**

## 04. How to Install

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/rexleimo/rex-cli.git

# 2. Install
cd rex-cli
./scripts/setup-all.sh --components all

# 3. Launch
codex
```

## 05. Why Open Source?

I know what you're thinking: with so many tools out there, why build another one?

**Because nobody understands the pain of tool fragmentation better than I do.**

Every day I was switching between three tools — losing context, duplicating config, risking key leaks... these problems had been grinding me down for too long.

Rather than endure it, I built a solution.

**RexCLI is my personal project, and it's the tool I use every single day.**

---

## 06. Closing Thoughts

**RexCLI isn't trying to replace Claude Code or Codex.**

It's just a "glue layer" that helps existing tools work better together.

If you feel the same pain, give it a try. If it helps, like and share — so more people can benefit.
