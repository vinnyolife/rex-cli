# AIOS RL Training System: From Synthetic Bugfixes to Mixed-Environment Learning

Since launching `aios orchestrate` live execution, we've been building something deeper underneath: a **multi-environment reinforcement learning system** that continuously improves the student policy across shell, browser, and orchestrator tasks — all sharing one unified training control plane.

This post explains what we built, why we built it that way, and what it unlocks.

## The Problem with Per-Environment RL

Before RL, the system had one "student" — an implicit behavioral prior that lived in skill prompts, dispatch policies, and harness heuristics. Each new capability required hand-tuning. The path from "works in demo" to "works reliably in production" was long and manual.

The obvious next step was reinforcement learning. But here's what we found quickly:

If we added shell RL, browser RL, and orchestrator RL by copying and modifying each control plane independently, we'd end up with **three similar but incompatible RL implementations**. That's how you get:
- Diverging rollback semantics
- Incomparable replay routing
- Environment-specific checkpoint lineage instead of system-wide
- Multiple teacher/judge integration layers that don't compose
- Debugging sessions dominated by "wait, why does browser RL do it differently?"

The right architecture was to **extract the shared control plane first**, then plug environments into it.

## Architecture: One Core, Three Environments

```
scripts/lib/rl-core/           ← Shared control plane
├── campaign-controller.mjs    ← collection/monitoring epoch orchestration
├── checkpoint-registry.mjs   ← active / pre_update_ref / last_stable lineage
├── comparison-engine.mjs     ← better / same / worse / comparison_failed
├── control-state-store.mjs   ← restart-safe control snapshots
├── epoch-ledger.mjs           ← epoch state + degradation streaks
├── replay-pool.mjs            ← four-lane routing (positive/neutral/negative/diagnostic)
├── reward-engine.mjs          ← environment reward + teacher shaping fusion
├── teacher-gateway.mjs        ← normalized teacher outputs (Codex/Claude/Gemini/opencode)
├── schema.mjs                 ← all shared contracts validated here
└── trainer.mjs                ← PPO entry points (online + offline)

scripts/lib/rl-shell-v1/       ← Shell environment (synthetic bugfix tasks)
scripts/lib/rl-browser-v1/      ← Browser environment (controlled real web flows)
scripts/lib/rl-orchestrator-v1/ ← Orchestrator environment (control decisions)
scripts/lib/rl-mixed-v1/       ← Mixed-environment campaigns
```

**RL Core** owns the common training-control plane. It defines the episode contract, batch semantics, comparison and degradation tracking, checkpoint lineage, rollback rules, replay routing, and trainer entry points.

**Environment adapters** own everything execution-specific: task sampling, episode execution, evidence collection, and environment-specific verification inputs. They implement a thin adapter interface — no RL logic leaks in.

## The Shared Episode Contract

Every episode — whether shell, browser, or orchestrator — produces the same structured output:

```typescript
Episode {
  episodeId: string;
  environment: 'shell' | 'browser' | 'orchestrator';
  taskId: string;
  trajectory: TrajectoryStep[];   // agent actions + observations
  outcome: 'success' | 'partial' | 'failure' | 'blocked';
  reward: number;
  teacherSignal?: TeacherSignal;  // present on failures + boundary episodes
  comparison?: ComparisonResult; // vs. previous policy
}
```

This uniformity is what makes cross-environment comparison and replay routing meaningful.

## Checkpoint Lineage: Three-Pointer Model

```
active ────────────── current policy in use
  │
  ├── pre_update_ref ── snapshot before last PPO update (rollback target)
  │
  └── last_stable ───── last comparison-confirmed stable policy
```

- Every PPO update creates a new `active` checkpoint.
- Before applying the update, the previous `active` becomes `pre_update_ref`.
- If the next comparison shows degradation, the system rolls back to `pre_update_ref`.
- After enough stable comparisons, `active` is promoted to `last_stable`.

This gives us **safe exploration with automatic rollback** — the core guarantee that makes online learning tractable.

## Replay Pool: Four Lanes

Instead of storing every episode, we route them into lanes by comparison outcome:

| Lane | Criteria | Usage |
|------|----------|-------|
| `positive` | better than previous policy | PPO + distillation |
| `neutral` | same as previous policy | diversity sampling |
| `negative` | worse than previous | KL regularization target |
| `diagnostic_only` | teacher-judged boundary cases | analysis, not training |

The routing is deterministic — based on comparison result, not a learned router. This keeps the system simple and debuggable.

## Mixed-Environment Campaigns

The most powerful capability is **mixed-environment campaigns** (`rl-mixed-v1`). One live batch can contain shell + browser + orchestrator episodes. The campaign controller:

1. Samples tasks across environments in balanced ratios.
2. Runs episodes concurrently.
3. Aggregates rewards and comparison outcomes.
4. Makes one rollback decision for the entire student — not per-environment.

This means shell bugfix episodes and orchestrator dispatch decisions can both improve the same student policy. The shared reward signal is "does this help the agent succeed at the end-to-end task?"

## Training Phases

- **Phase 1 (V1)**: Synthetic shell bugfix tasks with teacher shaping. Reproducible, fast iteration.
- **Phase 2**: Real shell repository tasks. Same student, harder distribution.
- **Phase 3**: Online monitoring + promotion. Rollback-protected live updates.
- **Phase B**: Browser adapter — controlled real web flows (auth walls, form submissions, scroll patterns).
- **Phase C**: Orchestrator adapter — high-value control decisions (preflight gating, dispatch routing, quality signals).
- **Phase D/E**: Mixed-environment validation — all three environments together.

## What This Unlocks

With a shared student policy across environments, we can:

- **Improve dispatch routing** by training on orchestrator decisions: which tasks should go to subagent vs. dry-run vs. human gate?
- **Reduce false positives** in clarity-gate by training on blocked-checkpoint episodes: what does a genuine "needs human" signal look like vs. noise?
- **Sharpen browser automation** by training on web interaction patterns: what click sequences reliably complete auth, form submission, or content creation?
- **Cross-pollinate learnings**: shell RL improvements on error recovery also help browser tasks that hit errors.

## How to Run

```bash
# Shell RL: benchmark generation → training → evaluation
node scripts/rl-shell-v1.mjs benchmark-generate --count 20
node scripts/rl-shell-v1.mjs train --epochs 5
node scripts/rl-shell-v1.mjs eval

# Mixed-environment campaign
node scripts/rl-mixed-v1.mjs mixed --browser-only
node scripts/rl-mixed-v1.mjs mixed --orchestrator-only
node scripts/rl-mixed-v1.mjs mixed --mixed

# Evaluate mixed campaign
node scripts/rl-mixed-v1.mjs mixed-eval
```

## Current Status

- RL Core: **stable** — all shared contracts validated, 40+ tests passing
- Shell RL V1: **stable** — Phase 1 + 2 implemented, Phase 3 online monitoring in progress
- Browser RL V1: **beta** — adapter + eval harness implemented
- Orchestrator RL V1: **beta** — adapter + eval harness implemented
- Mixed-environment campaigns: **experimental** — end-to-end validated on held-out tasks

The next milestone is **Phase D/E validation**: confirming that mixed-environment training produces a student that outperforms single-environment training on held-out tasks across all three environments.
