Browser MCP is available through the repo-local AIOS server and should be preferred for browser work.

For browser tasks, use this operating pattern unless the user explicitly asks otherwise:
- Connect to a visible CDP browser first: `chrome.launch_cdp` then `browser.connect_cdp`.
- On dense or dynamic pages, prefer `page.semantic_snapshot` first for compact headings/actions before choosing the next step.
- Before acting, read the page state with `page.extract_text`; use `page.get_html` only when text is insufficient.
- Work in short read -> act -> verify loops. Do not chain multiple blind browser actions.
- For clear button/link labels, prefer `page.click_text` before constructing low-level locators.
- Prefer visible text or role-based targets. If a locator is not unique, inspect again and narrow the target instead of guessing.
- After navigation or major actions, use `page.wait` when a state transition is expected, then re-read the page.
- Use `page.screenshot` only as a visual fallback when text/HTML evidence is not enough.
- For complex browser tasks, first summarize the current page, then state the next single action, then execute it.
- When `puppeteer-stealth` is available, use its browser-use toolchain (`chrome.*` / `browser.*` / `page.*`) for normal business flows instead of `chrome-devtools`.
